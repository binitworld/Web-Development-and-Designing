# Oasis Infobyte Web Development and Designing Internship

Welcome to my internship repository for Web Development and Designing at Oasis Infobyte! During my time at Oasis Infobyte, I had the opportunity to work on three exciting tasks that allowed me to enhance my skills in web development and design. Below is an overview of each task along with links to preview screenshots:

## Task 1: Landing Page (Travel Theme)
For the first task, I created a captivating landing page with a theme inspired by the world of travel. The landing page is designed to evoke the excitement and adventure associated with exploring new destinations. It features a visually appealing layout, stunning imagery, and user-friendly navigation to provide a seamless experience for visitors.

## Task 2: Portfolio Web-page
Task 2 involved crafting a standout portfolio that showcases my skills and projects in a unique way. I opted for a neon theme, creating a visually striking and modern portfolio that stands out from the crowd. The portfolio not only highlights my accomplishments but also reflects my creativity and attention to detail.

## Task 3: Temperature Converter (Interactive Design)
For the third task, I developed a temperature converter with an innovative twist. As the temperature decreases, the color of the screen dynamically changes, providing a visually engaging representation of temperature variations. This interactive design not only serves a practical purpose but also adds a creative element to a commonly used tool.
